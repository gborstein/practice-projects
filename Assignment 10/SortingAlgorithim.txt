Certainly! Here's an assignment for creating a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer in Java:

**Sorting Algorithm Visualizer Assignment**

**Objective:**
Develop a Java program that visually demonstrates the working of various sorting algorithms. The visualizer should allow users to choose a sorting algorithm, input an array of numbers, and observe the step-by-step execution of the chosen algorithm.

**Features to Implement:**

1. **Sorting Algorithms:**
   - Choose at least three sorting algorithms to implement in the visualizer. Common choices include Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.

2. **Visual Representation:**
   - Create a graphical user interface (GUI) to visually represent the array being sorted. Use bars or other visual elements to represent each element of the array.

3. **Algorithm Selection:**
   - Allow users to choose the sorting algorithm they want to visualize.

4. **Input Array:**
   - Enable users to input an array of numbers that the chosen sorting algorithm will process. Display the initial state of the array.

5. **Step-by-Step Execution:**
   - Implement a step-by-step execution feature that shows the changes in the array at each iteration of the sorting algorithm. Highlight the elements being compared and swapped.

6. **Speed Control:**
   - Include a speed control feature that allows users to adjust the speed of the visualization. Users should be able to observe the sorting process in real-time or at a slower pace.

7. **Reset and Restart:**
   - Provide options to reset the array to its initial state and restart the visualization for a different algorithm.

**Submission Guidelines:**

1. **Code Submission:**
   - Submit the complete Java source code for your Sorting Algorithm Visualizer.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Provide clear documentation explaining the design choices, structure of classes, and details about the implemented sorting algorithms.

3. **User Guide:**
   - Include a user guide on how to use the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer. Explain the available operations, algorithm selection, input array format, and speed control.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test your program thoroughly, especially considering various input arrays and different sorting algorithms.

5. **Reflection:**
   - Write a reflection on the challenges faced, lessons learned, and potential improvements for future iterations of the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer.

**Tips:**
- Break down the problem into smaller tasks before starting the implementation.
- Utilize Java's Swing library or another GUI library for creating an interactive user interface.
- Implement each sorting algorithm as a separate module, allowing for easy addition of new algorithms.

This Sorting Algorithm Visualizer assignment will not only enhance your Java programming skills but also provide practical experience in designing and implementing visualizations of algorithmic processes. Enjoy working on the assignment!
