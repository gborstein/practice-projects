Certainly! Here's an assignment for creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java:

**Tic-Tac-Toe Game Assignment**

**Objective:**
Develop a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java that provides a two-player experience. The game should include features such as user input validation, win detection, and an option to play multiple rounds.

**Features to Implement:**

1. **Game Board:**
   - Create a 3x3 grid to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe game board.

2. **Player Turns:**
   - Implement a system for alternating turns between two players (Player X and Player O).

3. **User Input Validation:**
   - Validate user input to ensure that players make valid moves. For example, make sure they enter coordinates within the valid range and select an empty cell.

4. **Win Detection:**
   - Develop a mechanism to detect when a player has won the game by aligning three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

5. **Draw Detection:**
   - Implement a draw detection feature to recognize when the game ends in a tie.

6. **Multiple Rounds:**
   - Allow players to choose whether they want to play another round after the game concludes. Keep track of the overall score.

7. **Display Board:**
   - Display the current state of the game board after each move.

**Submission Guidelines:**

1. **Code Submission:**
   - Submit the complete Java source code for your Tic-Tac-Toe game.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Provide clear documentation explaining the design choices, structure of classes, and any external libraries or APIs utilized (if any).

3. **User Guide:**
   - Include a user guide on how to play the Tic-Tac-Toe game. Explain the available operations, input formats, and how the game detects wins and draws.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test your program thoroughly, especially considering edge cases like entering invalid coordinates or attempting to make a move on an already occupied cell.

5. **Reflection:**
   - Write a reflection on the challenges faced, lessons learned, and potential improvements for future iterations of the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

**Tips:**
- Break down the problem into smaller tasks before starting the implementation.
- Consider using a two-dimensional array to represent the game board.
- Implement methods or functions to handle specific functionalities (e.g., validating moves, checking for wins).

This Tic-Tac-Toe game assignment will not only enhance your Java programming skills but also provide practical experience in designing and implementing game logic. Enjoy working on the assignment!
