Certainly! Here's an assignment for creating a Hangman game in Java:

**Hangman Game Assignment**

**Objective:**
Develop a console-based Hangman game in Java that allows players to guess a word by suggesting letters. The game should include features such as word selection, incorrect guesses tracking, and the ability to play multiple rounds.

**Features to Implement:**

1. **Word Selection:**
   - Implement a system to randomly select a word from a predefined list for the player to guess.

2. **Word Display:**
   - Display the word as a series of underscores, with the correct letters revealed as the player makes correct guesses.

3. **Incorrect Guess Tracking:**
   - Track the incorrect guesses made by the player. Display the hangman figure progressively for each incorrect guess.

4. **User Input Validation:**
   - Validate user input to ensure that players enter valid guesses (single letters).

5. **Game Over Conditions:**
   - Implement conditions for the game to end, either when the player successfully guesses the word or when the hangman figure is complete.

6. **Multiple Rounds:**
   - Allow players to choose whether they want to play another round after the current game concludes. Keep track of the overall score.

7. **Word Database:**
   - Include a database of words that the game can randomly select from. Allow for easy expansion or customization of the word list.

**Submission Guidelines:**

1. **Code Submission:**
   - Submit the complete Java source code for your Hangman game.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Provide clear documentation explaining the design choices, structure of classes, and details about the word database.

3. **User Guide:**
   - Include a user guide on how to play the Hangman game. Explain the available operations, input formats, and the conditions for winning or losing.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test your program thoroughly, especially considering different words, user input variations, and game-over conditions.

5. **Reflection:**
   - Write a reflection on the challenges faced, lessons learned, and potential improvements for future iterations of the Hangman game.

**Tips:**
- Break down the problem into smaller tasks before starting the implementation.
- Utilize arrays or strings to manage the word and track correct/incorrect guesses.
- Consider adding ASCII art for the hangman figure to enhance the visual experience.

This Hangman Game assignment will not only enhance your Java programming skills but also provide practical experience in designing and implementing game logic. Enjoy working on the assignment!
