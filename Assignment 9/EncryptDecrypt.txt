Certainly! Here's an assignment for creating a File Encryption/Decryption program in Java:

**File Encryption/Decryption Assignment**

**Objective:**
Develop a Java program that performs file encryption and decryption using a chosen encryption algorithm. The program should allow users to encrypt a file with a provided key and decrypt it later using the same key.

**Features to Implement:**

1. **Encryption Algorithm:**
   - Choose a simple encryption algorithm (e.g., Caesar cipher, XOR-based encryption) for the assignment.

2. **Key-based Encryption:**
   - Implement a key-based encryption system. The user should provide a key during encryption, and the same key should be used for decryption.

3. **File Input and Output:**
   - Allow users to specify the input file (file to be encrypted) and the output file (where the encrypted data will be stored).

4. **Encryption Process:**
   - Develop the encryption process that takes the contents of the input file, applies the chosen encryption algorithm, and writes the encrypted data to the output file.

5. **Decryption Process:**
   - Implement the decryption process that reads the encrypted data from a file and applies the reverse of the encryption algorithm to retrieve the original content.

6. **User Interface:**
   - Create a console-based user interface to interact with the program. Allow users to choose between encryption and decryption, specify input/output files, and provide the encryption key.

**Submission Guidelines:**

1. **Code Submission:**
   - Submit the complete Java source code for your File Encryption/Decryption program.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Provide clear documentation explaining the design choices, structure of classes, and details about the chosen encryption algorithm.

3. **User Guide:**
   - Include a user guide on how to use the File Encryption/Decryption program. Explain the available operations, input formats, and the importance of keeping the encryption key secure.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test your program thoroughly, especially considering edge cases like providing an incorrect key during decryption or attempting to encrypt a non-existent file.

5. **Reflection:**
   - Write a reflection on the challenges faced, lessons learned, and potential improvements for future iterations of the File Encryption/Decryption program.

**Tips:**
- Consider using Java's input/output streams for reading and writing files.
- Focus on making the program modular, allowing for easy replacement of the encryption algorithm in the future.
- Keep security considerations in mind, especially when handling encryption keys.

This File Encryption/Decryption assignment will not only enhance your Java programming skills but also provide practical experience in implementing basic cryptographic operations. Enjoy working on the assignment!
