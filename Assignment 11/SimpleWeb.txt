Certainly! Here's an assignment for creating a Simple Web Scraper in Java:

**Simple Web Scraper Assignment**

**Objective:**
Develop a Java program that performs basic web scraping to extract information from a website. The scraper should retrieve specific data elements from the HTML content of a web page and display or store the results.

**Features to Implement:**

1. **User Input:**
   - Allow the user to input the URL of the website they want to scrape.

2. **HTML Download:**
   - Implement functionality to download the HTML content of the specified web page.

3. **Data Extraction:**
   - Define the data elements you want to extract (e.g., titles, links, paragraphs). Implement logic to parse the HTML and extract these elements.

4. **Display or Store Results:**
   - Provide options for users to either display the extracted data on the console or store it in a file.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement proper error handling to deal with issues such as invalid URLs, network errors, or parsing failures.

**Submission Guidelines:**

1. **Code Submission:**
   - Submit the complete Java source code for your Simple Web Scraper.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Provide clear documentation explaining the design choices, structure of classes, and details about the implemented web scraping logic.

3. **User Guide:**
   - Include a user guide on how to use the Simple Web Scraper. Explain the available operations, input formats, and error handling.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test your program with different websites, considering variations in HTML structure.

5. **Reflection:**
   - Write a reflection on the challenges faced, lessons learned, and potential improvements for future iterations of the Simple Web Scraper.

**Tips:**
- Break down the problem into smaller tasks before starting the implementation.
- Utilize a library like JSoup for parsing HTML content.
- Consider allowing users to specify the data elements they want to extract or make it customizable.

This Simple Web Scraper assignment will not only enhance your Java programming skills but also provide practical experience in working with web scraping techniques. Enjoy working on the assignment!
