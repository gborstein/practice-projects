Certainly! Here's an assignment for creating an advanced temperature converter in Java:

**Advanced Temperature Converter Assignment**

**Objective:**
Develop an advanced temperature converter in Java that not only converts between different temperature units but also includes additional features such as historical conversion tracking, unit customization, and support for various temperature scales.

**Features to Implement:**

1. **Temperature Unit Support:**
   - Implement support for multiple temperature units, including Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, and any additional scales you find interesting (e.g., Rankine).

2. **Bi-Directional Conversion:**
   - Allow users to convert temperatures from one unit to another and vice versa.

3. **Historical Conversion Tracking:**
   - Implement a history feature that keeps track of the user's recent conversions. Allow users to view and clear their conversion history.

4. **Customizable Units:**
   - Provide an option for users to customize the list of temperature units they want to work with. Allow them to add or remove units.

5. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
   - Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the temperature converter. Use JavaFX or another GUI library to enhance the user experience.

6. **Temperature Scale Information:**
   - Include information about each temperature scale, such as its freezing and boiling points, in the GUI.

7. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement proper error handling to deal with invalid input and unexpected situations.

**Submission Guidelines:**

1. **Code Submission:**
   - Submit the complete Java source code for your advanced temperature converter.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Provide clear documentation explaining the design choices, structure of classes, and any external libraries or APIs utilized (if any).

3. **User Guide:**
   - Include a user guide on how to use the advanced temperature converter. Explain the available operations, customization options, and viewing conversion history.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test your program thoroughly, especially considering edge cases like extreme temperature values and custom unit configurations.

5. **Reflection:**
   - Write a reflection on the challenges faced, lessons learned, and potential improvements for future iterations of the temperature converter.

**Tips:**
- Break down the problem into smaller tasks before starting the implementation.
- Consider using object-oriented principles to design classes for temperature conversion and history tracking.
- Utilize JavaFX or another GUI library for creating an interactive user interface.

This advanced temperature converter assignment will not only enhance your Java programming skills but also provide practical experience in designing and implementing feature-rich applications. Enjoy working on the assignment!
